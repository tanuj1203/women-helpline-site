      <h4 class="heading-4">Why is self defence important?</h4>
      <p>India’s numbers representing the heinous crimes against women are shocking. In 2016, India recorded <strong>106</strong> rapes a day and four out of every ten victims were minors. Additionally, <strong>abductions, acid attacks, physical abuse, molestation, stalking, eve-teasing</strong>– these are the known crimes occurring in India every single day. Women for no fault of their own, even little girls are attacked with such brutality – that now there is a fear brewing in our minds. Knowing self defense is <strong>vital</strong> in protecting oneself from any threat or violence and to prepare ourselves to deal with actual life situations. Confidence: There is nothing more empowering than having the confidence to analyse a dangerous situation and take actions to overcome them effectively.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h4 class="heading-4">Pepper Spray</h4> <p>Despite violence and crimes against women making headlines daily, only a <strong>small</strong> fraction of women living in the metropolitan cities carry safety tools. Not only can these weapons save you during unfortunate, uncalled for situations but they can also provide a sense of security. Pepper spray is banned in many countries. However, the use of these sprays for self defence is <strong>legal</strong> in India. A can of spray that costs around INR 200-300 can save a life. The link below will explain the do's & don'ts of owning pepper spray.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h4 class="heading-4">TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS</h4>
    <p>Too many women enroll in a self-defense class after they've been assaulted. When they recount the
      incident, they often say the same thing: “I had this bad feeling, but I told myself not to be paranoid,”
      or “I knew I shouldn’t have gone, but I didn’t want to hurt his feelings.”
      If something doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t safe — that’s the bottom line. Many women have been  <strong> conditioned</strong>
     to ignore the little voice that tells them trouble is coming. Whether you realise it or not, when you are in danger, your brain and body respond reflexively. Your instinct is the best
      detector of danger. The next time you hear that little voice, listen to what it’s saying.</p>
      <p class="bold"> Gut instinct is often right!</p>
